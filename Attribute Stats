Heroes will be able to learn their basic skill at level 1 and upgrade them at level 6 14 22, and for ultimates they will be able to
learn them at level 10 and upgrade them at level 20 and 30, their is some heroes that will ignore that rule.

ALL HEROES cannot pass more that 50% damage reduction, for armor and magic resist the maximum cap is 75% for reducing damge with
elemental resist its 75% - some type of spell or passive may have like physical and fire damage in one

the damage reduction to anything that can be higher than 50% will only work with some skill of heroes

IF THE HERO RESISTENCE ARE MORE THAN 99% IT WILL NOT WORK, combining damage resist with others will cap it at 90% max damage reduction
