Huskar idea spells

His Q could be 2 second cooldown and having auto-cast but having high mana cost like 100 115 130 145 dealing insane burn damage
to the enemys that stack and refresh the duration and being the only spell that does alot of damage for him

His W could be a defence stand when active reducing the total damage he does but having massive increase defense in return

his E could have a mix of damage and defence he deal some of his health in damage and get some defence base on the damage done

His D or F passive could be like berserker blood getting small increase into damage and high defence the more lower health huskar got


later change for Enigma

might change his Gravity Well talent to be something better and more fun
