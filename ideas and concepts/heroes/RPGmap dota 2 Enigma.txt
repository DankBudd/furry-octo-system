Void Curse works very well with Gravity Well when having its talent level 10 that increase stun and roots duration making Gravity Well
even more effective and if enemys has alot of Health or magic resist the life regeneration they lose from Void Curse can help out deal
damage to them. Having the talent level 10 of Void Curse with Void Star talent level 25 can make up the most deadly combos enigma can
have!

even more powerfull in terms of damage and having Gravity well talent at level 10 with Talent level 25 of Gravity Lord making it having
the most insane damage spell in 1 shot up to 100 damage and more

GALAXY TIPS AND COMBOS
